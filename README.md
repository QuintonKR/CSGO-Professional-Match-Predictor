# CSGO Professional Match Predictor
This is a project that can predict the winner of CSGO professional matches based on the winrates of teams of every map, their ranking on the HLTV ladder, and the teams playing. 
It is based on a Kaggle dataset which has compiled about five years of professional CSGO matches.
The picks.csv file contains map picks from every match.
The results.csv file contains match results from every match.
The team_map_wr2.csv file contains the win rates on every map for each unique team in the results.csv file.
This notebook file was adapted from a Kaggle notebook, so the parts of the first cell that are not the imports can be commented out.
